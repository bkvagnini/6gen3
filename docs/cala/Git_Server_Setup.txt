-+- Git Server Installation-+-

1) Install Ubuntu Server 12.04 or later (prefer 13.10)
    (install SSH and Samba as part of the install)

2) Create a programmers group (gardeners) on the server, as well as a folder to contain the files

3) Sign in as user git 
    (git:calaisgr8)

4) Make the folder for SSH
    mkdir .ssh 

5) Create the file authorized_keys
    touch .ssh/authorized_keys 

6) Copy the user generated public key to .ssh/authorized_keys
    cat id_rsa.USERNAME.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys

7) Confirm the addition of the newly copied key
    vim .ssh/authorized_keys 
        (located under /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys)

(The above are the commands that Sean ran on Catkin as the user git)


--To add a new user to the Git Server--
0) Log into the Server

1) Add a new user 
    sudo adduser USERNAME  (e.g. sudo adduser bvagnini)

2) Add new user to the group
    sudo usermod -a -G GROUPNAME USERNAME (e.g. sudo usermod -a -G gardeners bvagnini)

3) Add USERNAME to the list of users
    sudo nano /etc/samba/smbusers
    (e.g. USERNAME="USERNAME" or bvagnini="bvagnini")

4) Edit the valid users under the Shares portion of the smb.conf file
    sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf 
        (edit the valid users under [files] and [git] and add USERNAME to it)

5) Add the user 
    sudo smbpasswd -L -a USERNAME (-a means to add)
    
6) Enable the user 
    sudo smbpasswd -L -e USERNAME (-e means to enable)

7) Restart the Samba service
    sudo service smbd restart

--Creating the SSH key for the user--
1) Creating the public and private SSH keys on your machine
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "USERNAME@EMAILADDRESS" 
    (e.g ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "bvagnini@cala.fsu.edu" 
    This process will prompt for a password- you will need something fairly good and will need to remember it for step #? later

2) Copy the public key generated in the above step 
    cp id_rsa.pub id_rsa.brian.pub

3) Copy the copied public key to the Git Server
    scp id_rsa.brian.pub git@catkin:/home/git
