To force all connections to be SMB1:
Open A terminal window
paste in the following line followed by the return key(should be all on one line):  
echo "[default]" >> ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf; echo "smb_neg=smb1_only" >> ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf

What the command does:
Creates a file called nsmb.conf  in your  home directory at the path ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf.
Adds directives to force SMB connections to use the SMB1 protocol.  This is slower but stable.

How to remove the workaround:
Open a terminal window
paste in the following at the prompt and then hit the return button:
rm ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf
