SSR to DSR / SAR to DAR comparison
We also typically run an awk script ( /script/sar_to_dar.sh and /script/ssr_to_dsr.sh) to perform a comparison between ours and theirs. It will require 2 folders inside of /data - /sar_dar and ssr_dsr. When the awk script finishes, it will produce a file called difference.txt. We report this file to DOE. It also creates 2 other files (other than the DARs, SARs, and DSRs placed there). These are sorted_our_dar_file.txt  (or dsr) and sorted_their_dar_file.txt (or dsr). 

NOTE: You will need to place the AGG or SSR file inside of this directory for the awk script to function properly. UNZIP the files first!
You will also need to remove district 98 from the DAR by deleting it from the SAR_DAR folder. 

Getting Started
The most efficient way to do this process is to be inside of the data/sar_dar directory when running the script/sftp.sh, then get all of the files (get *.*) from the path provided (you may have to call the sftp script via ../.././script.sftp.sh ). This will dump ALL the files inside of the sar_dar folder. To move just the DSR files, run the following from inside of the sar_dar folder: 

mv *DSR*.txt ../ssr_dsr

This will move the DSR files to the ssr_dsr folder for you. Switch to that folder.
Next, run the following to combine the SSR files into 1 file (do this for both folders):

cat R04WSSR0c.txt R08WSSR0c.txt R10WSSR0c.txt > our_ssr_file.txt

Then, verify in the ssr_to_dsr.sh file the length and the correct start and end positions of the pas via the DSR layout, not the SSR layout. This step isn’t required in the sar_dar.sh script.

Now, change directories back to the scoring_reporting folder and run the script/ssr_to_dsr.sh our_ssr_file.txt and script/sar_to_dar.sh our_agg_file.txt (for the sar_dar process, you may be able to use the concatenated file they provided (FCAT_14SPR_SAR_WRIT.txt))

This script requires an argument for the SSR or SAR file that it will run against. In our case, it’s our_ssr_file.txt.

Finding the cause of Issues: (e.g. they excluded school type 17 from their DSR files)
To find the count of the schools that are of type 17 (at position 79, per the DSR Layout):
awk ‘substr($0, 79, 2)==”17” {print}’ data/ssr_dsr/our_ssr_file.txt > temp
then wc -l temp to get the line count.
