-+-On Git Server-+-
SSH to the server from a Terminal window
	ssh git@GITSERVER
Change directories to /home/git if not already there (pwd will tell you where you are)
	cd /home/git 

-Create the remote repo folder-
	mkdir newProject.git
ls -a to verify its creation
Change directory to get into the repo
	cd newProject.git
We need to initialize the repo at this point, even though it’s empty on the server
	git --bare init

-+-On local machine-+-
Make the directory 
	mkdir newProject
 Change directories to get inside of it
	cd newProject
Initialize git so that it’s tracking what happens in that folder
	git init
It will return:
HOSTNAME:newProject USERNAME$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

MAKE CHANGES- WRITE CODE- Go to TAHITI

Add your changed files
	git add .
Commit your changes to your local branch (master / develop/ whatever it’s called)
	git commit -m “Message goes here”

Now you need to add the remote repo to your local project
	git remote add origin git@GITSERVER:/home/git/newProject.git

You can confirm the creation of it.
	git remote

Finally, you can push your changes to the code in your local master branch to your newly added remote
	git push origin master

-+-2nd machine-+-
Change to your projects folder (where all of your projects live)
	git clone git@GITSERVER:/home/git/newProject.git

OR

Make the directory 
	mkdir newProject
 Change directories to get inside of it
	cd newProject
Initialize git so that it’s tracking what happens in that folder
	git init
It will return:
HOSTNAME:newProject USERNAME$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Now you need to add the remote repo to your local project
	git remote add origin git@GITSERVER:/home/git/newProject.git

You can confirm the creation of it.
	git remote

Finally, you can pull your changes to the code from your newly added remote to your local master branch
